# Rewrite Tripwire

If you are considering a rewrite, stop and answer:

1. What exact behavior is broken right now?
2. Can it be fixed without changing architecture?
3. Has this exact issue appeared in previous rewrites?
4. Am I reacting to discomfort rather than a real constraint?

If any answer is unclear, do not rewrite.
